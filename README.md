> This project is composed of 14 levels. Each level has a security breach that gives you access to the next one.

In this project I learned about:
- Analysing binaries
- Injecting code using unprotected inputs/parameters
- Usecure system calls such as `access`

Useful tools:
- Virtual machine using docker / virtualbox
- John the ripper
- wireshark, tshark
- radare2, gdb
- other unix commands: netstat, top, getfacl, ltrace, strace
